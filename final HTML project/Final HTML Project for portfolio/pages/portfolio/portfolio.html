    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I am a web &amp; Mobile Development student attending Bridgerland Tech located in logan Utah. Currently I have skills in html, PHP, CSS, and databases and server applications. I am working on getting into the tech industry for my career because I am seeking new oportunitites and a challenge. I started out doing construction and landscaping. Things I did while working construction include safety inspector, carpentry and dirt work fixing pipelines. I would say that I am person that lives by principles and I find quotes and good music that lift me up and I try to apply it to my life in a way that is positive. In this way I would say im a man of principles. One of my favorite songs I like is "if today was your last day" by <i>KnickelBack.</i> I am 20 years old as of April 17,2001. Some skills that I have gotten from school are FEMA certifications, First Aid certifications, Flagger, boating license, and tracking skills. Some accomplishments that I am proud of would be getting put on the Honor gaurd in Military highschool, and doing a MOC excercise with search and rescue. My most prized awards are from the Military school I attended. I became the highest ranking student in my battlion as a first round Staff sergeant. This award was the result of hard work waking up at 5:00am in the morning and working hard to be at top. I also recieved the lamp of knowledge and multiple ribbons for other accomplishments. A sample of some of the work that I have done is actually the page your reading from. The page that your reading from was made with HTML and CSS and then given a domain adress and host to where you are able to see it now. A another project I have done in school is listed here. <a href= "https://ruebendurfee.huskisites.com/basic_html/">here</a> Some examples of the construction I used to do is also shown below.</p>
