    <h2>Rueben Durfee's Biography</h2>
        <p>Hello I am Rueben Durfee originally from Newplymouth Idaho. I graduated from a quasi military highschool called the Idaho youth challenge accademy in Pierce Idaho. I graduated with multiple certifications from FEMA such as ICS0100,0200,0700, and along the way I also took a ham radio course and passed it but did not recieve the license. 
        after some exciting experience in highschool, I worked in construction for a short time being a safety inspector, and then worked at walmart as maintnance cleaning and fixing things. I also learned how to program one of the robots they use for scrubbing floors while working there.
        I am now a student at Bridgerland Tech for web &amp; Mobile Development. I am persuing a career in the tech industry because I am looking for new opportunities. 
        I hoping to get into the Front end Development, because I like to be outdoors and enjoying nature. I have plans to make a photography website where you can hire me or someone else to come out and use a drone or just get some photos taken for a party or a trip and possibly land surveyors.
        on my free time I like to play video games with friends and family and trade the stock market as a dividend investor I am persuing what they call a fire fund to become financially free by 25. I hold positions in 2 private companies better families and tast equity and then positions in 23 other public companies.
        my networth is above 10 thousand dollars at the time of me writing this biography. So if you are looking for someone who can handle larg ammounts of cash I have extensive experience. I also have a youtube channel where I have learned video edditing skills and if you want to
