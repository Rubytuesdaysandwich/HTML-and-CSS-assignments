                <h2>Rueben Durfee's Biography</h2>
                    <p style="padding-right:60px;">Hello I am Rueben Durfee originally from Newplymouth Idaho. I graduated with my diploma from a quasi military highschool called the Idaho youth challenge accademy in Pierce Idaho. I graduated with multiple certifications from FEMA such as ICS0100,0200,0700, and along the way I also took a ham radio course. 
                    after some exciting experiences in highschool, I worked in construction for a short time being a safety inspector, and then worked at walmart as maintnance cleaning and fixing things. I also learned how to program one of the robots they use for scrubbing floors while working there.
                    I am now a student at Bridgerland Tech for web &amp; Mobile Development. I am persuing a career in the tech industry because I am looking for new opportunities. 
                    my goal is to get into the Front end Development, to do this I am learning html, PHP, CSS, databases and mysql. I want to be a front end developer because I like being creative and I like to be outdoors and enjoying nature. I have plans to make a photography website where you can hire me or someone else to come out and use a drone or just get some photos taken for a party, trip, land surveyors or construction sites.
                    on my free time I like to go hiking, running and occasionally play video games with friends and family.  I also have a youtube channel where I have learned video edditing skills and if you want to
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIB_-Zl254fXPwWA_dCGGQQ"><b>check it out here</b></a>, I also have oher experience with using arduinos and c code and a small amount of soldering which I learned from apprenticing under a mentor prior to entering tech school.  Some financial goals I have are to be retired by 25 years old, the way I plan to do this is by buying dividend paying companies that will pay me monthly income that I can live on and pay bills with. In the world of investing they call this a fire fund and there are many that persue this goal. Currently I hold positions in 2 private companies better families, tast equity and positions in 23 other publicly traded companies.

                        <h2>About me</h2>
                        <p class="text-port">I am a web &amp; Mobile Development student attending Bridgerland Tech located in logan Utah. Currently I have skills in html, PHP, CSS, and databases and server applications. I am working on getting into the tech industry for my career because I am seeking new oportunitites and a challenge. I started out doing construction and landscaping. Things I did while working construction include safety inspector, carpentry and dirt work fixing pipelines. I would say that I am person that lives by principles and I find quotes and good music that lift me up and I try to apply it to my life in a way that is positive. In this way I would say im a man of principles. One of my favorite songs I like is "if today was your last day" by <i>KnickelBack.</i> I am 20 years old as of April 17,2001. Some skills that I have gotten from school are FEMA certifications, First Aid certifications, Flagger, boating license, and tracking skills. Some accomplishments that I am proud of would be getting put on the Honor gaurd in Military highschool, and doing a MOC excercise with search and rescue. My most prized awards are from the Military school I attended. I became the highest ranking student in my battlion as a first round Staff sergeant. This award was the result of hard work waking up at 5:00am in the morning and working hard to be at top. I also recieved the lamp of knowledge and multiple ribbons for other accomplishments. A sample of some of the work that I have done is actually the page your reading from. The page that your reading from was made with HTML and CSS and then given a domain adress and host to where you are able to see it now. A another project I have done in school is listed here. <a href= "https://ruebendurfee.huskisites.com/basic_html/">here</a> Some examples of the construction I used to do is also shown below.</p>

We did not have sports in this school however we were tested on our physical endurance three times throughout the school year which if we did not pass, we could be sent home. </p>
